## 🎨 The Personality Behind the Code

Bio for the humans: I turn coffee into production-ready code and have a slight obsession with making systems that don't break at 3 AM. When I'm not building full-stack applications or teaching Flutter to play nice with ML models, you'll find me organizing tech events or wondering why printers still exist in 2025.

The real talk: I believe technology should solve actual problems, not create new ones. Every line of code I write is with the understanding that somewhere, someone's workflow (or life) might depend on it working correctly.

Fun fact: I've organized events with 15,000+ participants, but I still get nervous presenting to a room of 20 people. Go figure.

## 🤝 Let's Build Something Together

I'm always interested in:
- Full-stack applications with complex backend requirements
- Mobile-first platforms that need to scale
- Analytics dashboards that replace manual processes
- Systems that need to be both secure and user-friendly
- Any interesting technical challenges that push boundaries

Code is read more often than it's written, so I write it like I'm leaving notes for my future self at 3 AM.
